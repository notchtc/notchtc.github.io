# Void Linux propaganda
This is a collection of stuff about Void Linux.

Maybe one day I will write something myself.

Here are some official Void related links:

Is Void Linux based? Yes. Void Linux is based.
No, really. Super based. Omega based.

Void Linux was built in such a way that it’s basically one of the most feature complete Linux distros that we’ve seen in recent times.

The developers of Void Linux are always listening to the community and make sure that their distro is up to the task of providing the best possible experience for everyone. That is the philosophy behind Void Linux and it is the main reason why it’s so popular.

Even though the software center isn’t as good as in the past or as featured in newer distributions, Void Linux is still a very good distro that I would recommend to anyone looking for a new distro.

After using Void Linux for a while, I found that it wasn’t really something that I would just use to replace my current distro. But I think that it has plenty of value for those looking for a new distro or for those who are interested in playing with a different flavor of Linux.

Void Linux is available for a wide variety of different architectures and, because it’s not based on anything, it works on all kinds of different hardware.

Even though it’s a Linux distro, I think that it’s something that works great on the Mac.

The developers and supporters of Void Linux are super friendly and the distro works great on pretty much any hardware out there.

I’ve heard from a lot of people who use it and absolutely love it.
And they are usually pretty big Linux users so they know what they are talking about.
I’ve also talked to some people who use Void Linux and can’t stand it.
I think that’s pretty normal. Not everyone will like the distro.

I used to be a distrohopper until I landed on Void.

Ngl, I thought that it was a shitty minimalist meme distro at first, but good lord it's really fucking good.

XBPS is a lot better than Pacman (what I used to use before) and runit is fast as fuck.

Moreover, I can get 99% of the packages I need from xbepis, and also compile them from source if I want to.

I love Void, I hope it lives a long and prosperous life; I'll be there with it throughout.
