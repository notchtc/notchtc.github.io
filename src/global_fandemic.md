The Machine Girl A2B2 Night Of Fire set, split by me (in opus).

[GLOBAL FANDEMIC DOWNLOAD](files/global_fandemic.zip)

# Details

Splitted by using ffmpeg and python (thanks [some dude from stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/280767/how-do-i-split-an-audio-file-into-multiple/400032#400032))
Cover art made by using youtube-dl, ffmpeg, [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) and gimp.

1. Downloaded 2 frames (the one with the global fandemic text and one before that) by doing [this](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1155446/is-it-possible-to-only-download-a-single-frame-from-a-youtube-video/1155468#1155468).
2. Removed most of the background from the frame with the text by using [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/).
3. Removed the rest of the background in gimp.
4. Cropped the frame without the text.
5. Added the text onto the frames.
