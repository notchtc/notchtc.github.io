The Machine Girl A2B2 Night Of Fire Set, split by me (in opus).

[[/global_fandemic.zip][Global Fandemic Download]]

* Details
Splitted by using ffmpeg and python (thanks [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/280767/how-do-i-split-an-audio-file-into-multiple/400032#400032][some dude from stackexchange]]).

Cover art made by using youtube-dl, ffmpeg, [[https://www.remove.bg][remove.bg]] and gimp.

1. Downloaded 2 frames (the one with the global fandemic text and one before that) by doing [[https://askubuntu.com/questions/1155446/is-it-possible-to-only-download-a-single-frame-from-a-youtube-video/1155468#1155468][this]].
2. Removed most of the background from the frame with the text by using [[https://www.remove.bg][remove.bg]].
3. Removed the rest of the background in gimp.
4. Cropped the frame without the text.
5. Added the text onto the frame.
