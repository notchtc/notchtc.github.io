The Machine Girl A2B2 Night Of Fire set, split by me (in [opus](https://opus-codec.org/)).

[GLOBAL FANDEMIC DOWNLOAD](/files/global_fandemic.zip)

## details
Split with [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [stolen code from Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/280767/how-do-i-split-an-audio-file-into-multiple/400032#400032).

## making of the cover art
1. Downloaded 2 frames (the one with the global fandemic text and one before that) with [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) and FFmpeg (obviously by getting the solution [from the internet](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1155446/is-it-possible-to-only-download-a-single-frame-from-a-youtube-video/1155468#1155468)).
2. Removed most of the background from the frame with the text by using [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/).
3. Removed the rest of the background in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
4. Cropped the frame without the text.
5. Added the text onto the frames.
