The Machine Girl A2B2 Night Of Fire Set, split by me (in opus).

link:/global_fandemic.zip[Global Fandemic Download]

== Details
Splitted by using ffmpeg and python (thanks https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/280767/how-do-i-split-an-audio-file-into-multiple/400032#400032[some dude from stackexchange]).

Cover art made by using youtube-dl, ffmpeg, https://www.remove.bg[remove.bg] and gimp.

. Downloaded 2 frames (the one with the global fandemic text and one before that) by doing https://askubuntu.com/questions/1155446/is-it-possible-to-only-download-a-single-frame-from-a-youtube-video/1155468#1155468[this].
. Removed most of the background from the frame with the text by using https://www.remove.bg[remove.bg].
. Removed the rest of the background in gimp.
. Cropped the frame without the text.
. Added the text onto the frame.
