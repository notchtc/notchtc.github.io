**NO OVERDUB. NO EQ. NO EFFECT-AS FINAL TRIBUTE**

Originally part of my review for "[不安な演奏 \[Anxious Performance\]](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/chtc/album/317412-/)", extended to continue from where I left off.
I'll be going through the project's history and shining a light on certain aspects.
I'd like to thank everyone supporting me and those who made this possible: people uploading scans, sharing interviews and other information, and those who helped me polish this up.

<small>(Due to the fluidity of members, I'll be referring to the project as a band most of the time from now on.)</small>

# Senzuri Beginnings (1-2-3-4!)

> In the beginning... the space. One day... a planet. In the sea... a land. And there... a city! And in the city? The Gero... What?!!!

Two men meet at an S\&M club in Shinjuku, Tokyo, in 1985[^1].
They're Juntaro Yamanouchi, who was 18 years old at this time, and Tetsuya Endoh (aka Gero 30), a 45-year-old exhibitionist[^2].
They began doing performances at the club[^3] in which they ate their own feces and rolled in them.
The audience (mainly middle-aged men) was masturbating; all Juntaro and Gero 30 could hear was their panting and excited snoring, especially because there was no background music.

> We could make love on stage at any time if we want to.
But we are not interested in doing it.
We prefer to experience something more exciting and thrilling feeling like we feel when we are doing masturbation.

That same year they form a band—the Gerogerigegege (the name being a combination of the Japanese onomatopoeia for vomiting \[gero], diarrhea \[geri], and \[gegege] could mean anything really; Juntaro might've picked it at random).

Besides Juntaro and Gero 30 (who are core members of the band), many other people come and go—they're mostly instrumentalists, although a few other exhibitionists also appeared.

> I'm not interest in a major label and I'm really not interested in rock band, rock n roll! THE GEROGERIGEGEGE do not want to be a rock band!

Their first release would be their self-titled cassette on Masami Akita's ZSF Produkt—it's a mechanical noise album, full of repetition, something very different from most Gerogerigegege releases.
The Gero's first-ever recording is closer to their well-known noisecore sound; well, it's basically the beginning of it.
Sure, maybe the instrumentation isn't nailed down yet, but the spirit and 1-2-3-4 countdown are there.
At the time of the band's creation, Juntaro was mostly listening to noise and Ramones live albums—it's easy to see how those inspired him.
He also was at the Ramones show at Seibu Theater in 1980.
According to him, all that could be heard after the title shout and countdown was noise due to the venue's poor acoustics at the time.

Gero's first show outside an S\&M club happened in October 1986.
The next year, they would release their first LP, "Senzuri Champion", on Juntaro's own label called Vis A Vis Audio Arts, which he founded the same year.
An evolution of the noise from their self-titled, with a bit of things to come. (noisecore on track 3 and male masturbation on the last track)

# Senzuri Champion(s)

After releasing "Senzuri Champion", The Gerogerigegege would explore these elements and more further.

1988 would see the release of "Showa"[^4] and "Sexual Behavior In The Human Male".
The former is their most infamous release, as it features 36 minutes of sexual intercourse bookended by Japan's national anthem and has a photo of Hirohito on the cover; it was also released disguised as a Ramones bootleg.
The latter is a punk/post-punk EP—it contains some of the most "normal" Gero material (although there still is some sex and masturbation on it).

The single "Ai-Jin" was also "released" this year.
It's a cover of Teresa Teng's song of the same name by Juntaro.
He made 2000 flexi discs and advertised a "Release Memorial Performance" at Enoshima Beach in music magazines.
Juntaro burned all copies (well, not really; they forgot to bring a few) in front of the crowd; Gero 30 had fun masturbating.

> Well, I cannot answer your question "why ?" but can only say that this is THE GEROGERIGEGEGE !

The only other things to be released are "Live at Tokyo Gay Center", a recording of male masturbation (if Juntaro's words are to be believed), and "吐き気がするほどオマンチンコだぜ! おまえは!" under the name The Omanko, which is just Juntaro stealing The Hater's Fuchait (which was released on his own label, by the way).

# Tokyo Anal Dynamite / Endless Humiliation

> Fuck compose, Fuck melody, Dedicated to no one, Thanks to no one, ART IS OVER.

The 90s saw many Gerogerigegege releases, new and recorded in the 80s, live and studio.
The decade is kicked off with the famous noisecore live album "Tokyo Anal Dynamite" and two singles: "All My Best to You, With Love, Juntaro", which contained stolen Cambodian pop songs, and "William Bennett Is My Dick", a parody of Whitehouse.

Plenty of albums and EPs followed in the early 90s, most of them being noisecore, with a few noise ones along the way.
A few works worth mentioning are: "Live Greatest Hits" (1991, compiles senzuri live performances); "Senzuri Power Up" (1991, compiles noise(core) tracks from the late 80s); "Mother Fellatio" and "Yellow Trash Bazooka" (1993, very fun noisecore EPs).

All of these 1-2-3-4 works go in their own direction, but one thing is consistent: bad sound quality.
When Juntaro started out The Gerogerigegege, he was crazy about the self-produced Japanese punk/hardcore cassettes, flexi discs, and records of the time.
Their bad sound quality gave the music an appeal different from live music; it made them more attractive.

In 1994, a different side of the band (Juntaro, to be specific) gets shown.
Alongside the noisecore masterpiece that is "Instruments Disorder", the harsh noise almost HNW nearing "Nothing To Hear / Nothing To...1985" and sound collage "Hotel Ultra", there's "Endless Humiliation", in which piano improvisation (recorded in 1993) is overlaid on top of a recording of a homeless man talking (from 1990).
It's a sad-sounding record, especially when compared to everything that came before.
Later works that venture more into this direction are "Piano River" and "Public Environment" (1995, field recordings and the manipulation of them, re-released as Blackout Archive Vol. 1 and 2, respectively); No Sound (1995, Musique concrète); Yasukuni Jinja (1996, power electronics).

A few conceptual releases like "Art Is Over" (an octopus tentacle glued to the inside of a cassette) and "0 Song EP" (a blank flexi disc) were also released during this time in small quantities.

The last two Gero albums (pre-hiatus) would be released in 1999, those being "Hell Driver" and "None Friendly".
The former is a harrowing, depressing mix of field recordings, piano improvisation, and drone recorded from 1992 to 1996.
The latter is a drone recording from 1987, one much friendlier than what Hell Driver offers; multiple drones run alongside each other.

# Early Dream Exit

> Personally, I think that Noise is also music.
I have made music by thinking so far that there are no genres, no distinctions and that Noise is music, since I sended the sounds themselves off.
My specific appreciation on music is maybe the reason why many people have been designating my work as "multi-genre".
It is often said that every piece turns out to be the contrary of the fans' expectations, which is not intentional (but was true for some lives).
If I made music intentionally everytime, there would remain no pleasure for me at all.
Anyway, I can say that, from the start, I have always created what I wanted to do.
And so will I.
The two main points concerning THE GEROGERIGEGEGE are: "Do not copy others" and "Human feelings", in our own sense.

The Geros didn't release much in the 2000s.
The year 2000 saw "Early Dream Exit", which turned old Gero recordings into dark ambient.
The next year saw two more releases: "Saturdaynight Big Cock Salaryman", a noisecore EP that's not even a little bit funny and instead is disturbing—Juntaro's vocals are just heart-breaking moans, shouts, and screams; and a split with the band Crowd Surfers Must Die—it's just a few stolen tracks from a Hiroshi Itsuki live album.
The last track to be released by The Gerogerigegege was the dark ambient track "環８の音が聞こえる (甲州街道Mix)" on the "Back Ground Music For Midnight Driving" compilation from 2002.
And then, total silence.

# _燃えない灰 / Unburnable Ash_

After 14 years of nothing (besides someone stating they talked with Juntaro in 2013), Juntaro made a powerful return in 2016 with "Moenai Hai" (recorded in 2014-2015).
Continuing where he left off with 1999's "Hell Driver", the album is a dark ambient/field recordings affair, a depressing journey with a bit of catharsis along the way.

After its release, Juntaro began reissuing and remixing old albums, making bootlegs of bootlegs, and returning to his old yet new ways.
His scouring of archives would bring us: "Senzuri Champion Revised" (2018), a collection of unreleased material from 1985-1988; the "Blackout Archive" (2019) series, which would contain re-releases of "Piano/River" and "Public Environment"; "Piss Shower Girlfriend" (2020), a harsh noise tape more on the humorous side from the late 80s/early 90s; "Tokyo Anal Dynamite Singles" (2020), a compilation of released and unreleased noisecore material. That's not even all of these, there also are splits and some rare releases.

Besides scouring the archives, Juntaro started putting out new material: "Moenai Hara" (2017), another stolen Hiroshi Itsuki song; "Uguisudani Apocalypse" (2019), a soundtrack for the Uguisudani line, mostly stolen lounge music; the ">(decrescendo)" series (2019, 2020, 2022), recordings of Juntaro playing a hapi drum in a park, though the later entries change things up a bit—pretty peaceful overall, maybe it's healing after "Moenai Hai"; and what I would call the "ero tape trilogy".

"不安な演奏 \[Anxious Performance\]" (2020) is a 10-hour box set of lo-fi erotic tapes, it's like an eavesdroppers' NatGeo documentary.
"直美のオナニーと若草寮案内 RE-ISSUE \[Naomi's Masturbation and Wakakusa Dormitory Guide RE-ISSUE\]" (2021) is a re-issue of an ero tape featuring a single woman moaning and talking, ordered from a pornographic magazine ad by Juntaro in the early 80s. Yet again the sound source is unmanipulated and lo-fi.
The last one of these is "新宿に命さびしむ歌多し [Shinjuku ni inochi sabi shimu uta ōshi]" and it's pretty different to the other two as this time it contains recordings of male love and doesn't have neither the eavesdropping aspect of "Anxious Performance" or the emptiness of "Naomi's Guide".
I guess it's fitting to return to where it all began after so many years.

# FINAL CHAPTER
## Where did Juntaro and Gero 30 go? What was going through their minds in the 90s/00s?

Little is known about the period between Juntaro's disappearance and return; I'd even argue we don't know a lot about him and others for the band's entire existence.
Many speculations were and still are being thrown around, even taken as fact by some.
Many people have already touched on these topics, so I won't talk about them, mostly because there isn't really a source for most of them.
I don't think "Hell Driver" had a lot, and maybe the lyrics for "Saturdaynight Big Cock Salaryman" have something, but I can't find a translation for them anywhere.
Juntaro did say that he was depressed recently (2021) in the liner notes for "As If It Had Always Been Determined Since This Day Was Born" (2022) though.

Gero 30 is nowhere to be found; some think he is dead, as he would be pretty old at this point, and he was hospitalized somewhere around the late 90s/early 00s.
Someone has apparently talked to a friend of Juntaro who said Gero 30 has passed away, if that is true, RIP.
I'd still take this with a grain of salt though, just in case.

There's a credit for Gero 30 on the track "ゲロゲリゲゲゲ のテーマ〜We Are The Gerogerigegege" from "Tokyo Anal Dynamite Singles" (2020).
I haven't heard a recording of him saying "Gerogerigegege" before, so I assume it's new, although Juntaro could've just taken something from his archives.
The liner notes for "AIIHABDSTDWB" also mention that his actual profession is private (Tamotsu Mochida has mistakenly written that Gero 30 is a futon seller in his book "INDUSTRIAL MUSIC FOR INDUSTRIAL PEOPLE!!!").
Why would Juntaro be talking about this if Gero 30 passed away? We'll probably never truly know about Gero 30's whereabouts.

## Gero-geri-gay-gay-gay

> Most of the concepts that the Gerogerigegege has pursued are "documentary" and "humanistic." When I released my 1st album "Senzuri Champion" released in 1987, I remembered in this work that I had already told my friend that "Senzuri" had the meaning of "passing human relationships" for The Gerogerigegege.

The sexual aspect of The Gerogerigegege isn't really talked about much in a serious way; most of the time, people are talking and laughing about Gero 30's shenanigans.
If the more "serious" releases didn't exist, the Gero's would probably be viewed as a troll/joke band even more.
There are plenty of other things you could have conversations about; hell, you could probably even manage to talk about the senzuri element in one way or another.
Now, I'm not saying everything Juntaro and Co. did is completely serious; they did engage in some trolling, and there is humor in plenty of their releases (which is a nice change).

> We are for homosexual love but not willing to get involved with any activities.
We have the O.C.C.U.R., the association for gays in Japan (this is not a musical band).
But gays here in Japan seem to have no guts to parade like gays do in the U.S.A.
I think that you will see more progressive attitude in the Gerogerigegege show.
First of all, gay people are not frank in nature.
If they try to hide who they are and to avoid associating with straight people, it is kind of natural that they are discriminated and looked down.
I am always in a woman's dress but nobody can tell I am gay.
Because I have been very open about it and living as a woman without any problem.

Also, isn't it better to see some dudes getting it on than real gore[^5] or something on the album cover? More bands should learn from Juntaro.

> The name "GEROGERIGEGEGE" has nothing to do with 'gay' in Japanese, but comes from vomiting (GERO), diarrhea (GERI), in Japanese, and the letters GEGEGE.
I was conscious of a feeling of freedom by choosing this name.
But I am very glad if you pronounce it "GERO-GERI-GAY-GAY-GAY".
Very good!!!

## The End
The Gerogerigegege is very interesting on many fronts—from the male masturbation and noisecore to the field recordings and erotic tapes.
What's the meaning of all of those, what's their purpose? You could just say that there are "unserious" and "serious" releases, that the sexual elements are just there to be funny or just for horniness sake, that the noise is just supposed to be noise.
I think doing something like that is a disservice to The Gerogerigegege's work and isn't the case at all.
I hope that people start seeing this project as more than just those "who made Showa" and "joke band turned depressing".

[^1]: In an interview for File 13 from 1991 Juntaro says they met in 1983/1984. He would've been underage at that time, perhaps a one-time mistake?
[^2]: From various interviews/liner notes I'm getting ages in the range of 45-48. Urashima said 45, so I'm gonna pick that too. Making someone younger is better than making someone older, right?
[^3]: Apparently they were dishwashers at first and Juntaro suggested doing performances to the club manager. I could only find a mention of this in the interview for File 13.
[^4]: Showa's actual release date is a bit of a wonky matter, it was released in either ‘88 or ‘89.
[^5]: Here's Juntaro's take on gore: "Many bands use the photos of dead body, gore for the record covers. I hate this cheap and foolish imagination."
