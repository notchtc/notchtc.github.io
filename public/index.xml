      <description>These are my awesome (actually horrible) dotfiles.
 Screenshots are located in the imgs folder and shown in README’s.
 This is a web version of the README. Go to the dotfiles repository for more things.

 I recommend looking through these dotfiles and changing things to fit your setup and/or needs if you want to use this.</description>
